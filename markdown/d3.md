## d3.js

* People think of it as a graphics and visualisation tool, but it stands for *Data Driven Documents*

* Take an array of JavaScript data, and produce document nodes from it...

* If the nodes you produce are SVG, you can produce a visualisation

---

## Selection

* d3 needs to know where in the document you want to update. Usually done with a CSS selector

  ```js
  d3.select("#myVisualisation")
  ```
  
* With a selection, you can modify the document

  ```js
  d3.select("#myVisualisation").append("svg").append("g")
  ```

---

## Working dynamically

* Usually, you want to have some elements that are kept in sync with some data in a JavaScript array

* `selectAll` lets you select the children of an element, and `data` lets you match that set against the array



  ```js
  let selection = d3.select("#list")
                .selectAll("li")
                .data(values)
  ```



  ```js
  d3.select("#locations").selectAll("p").data(asteroids)
  ```

---

## Working dynamically

* Now there's three selections we want to worry about to match the data:


  
  * existing nodes to update (the *update* selection)



  * new nodes to add (the *enter* selection)



  * existing nodes to remove (the *exit* selection)

---

## Existing nodes

* The update selection is selected by default. You can just call functions on it to update these elements' parameters

* You pass in the function that'll do the updating. It gets called on each element in turn

* eg, this updates the text content of the `<li>` elements:



```js
    let selection = d3.select("#list")
                .selectAll("li")
                .data(values)

    selection.text(function(d, i) {
        return d.toPrecision(3)
    })
```

---

## Existing nodes

This is an example from a demo using TypeScript:

```ts
d3.select("#locations").selectAll("p").data(asteroids)
      .text((body:Body) =>
        body.name + " is at " + Math.floor(body.x) + "," + Math.floor(body.y)
      )
```

---

## New nodes to add

* `enter()` selects the data we don't currently have nodes for.

* And then we say what we want to do for each of those. Usually, append something and set its attributes

```js
    selection.enter().append("li").text(function(d, i) {
        return d
    })
```

---

## New nodes to add

A Typescript example using an arrow function:

```ts
      .enter().append("p").text((body:Body) =>
        body.name + " is at " + Math.floor(body.x) + "," + Math.floor(body.y)
      );
```

---

## Nodes to remove

* `exit()` selects the nodes that no longer match any of the elements of the array

* often we just call `remove()` on these to take them out of the visualisation

```js
   .exit().remove()
```

---

## Updating paths

* SVG paths are very useful, but all the location information is *inside the `d` attribute*

```svg
<svg width="500" height="200" version="1.1"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <g stroke="blue" stroke-width="5" fill="none">
    <path d="M0,50 l50,30 l50,-30 l50,40 c 50,-50 100,50 150,-70 z" />
  </g>
</svg>
```

<svg width="500" height="200" version="1.1"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <g stroke="blue" stroke-width="5" fill="none">
    <path d="M0,50 l50,30 l50,-30 l50,40 c 50,-50 100,50 150,-70 Z" />
  </g>
</svg>

* So d3.js includes quite a few functions to help with these

---

## line

* Helps to produce the locations to put into a `<path d=` attribute

```js
  line = d3.line()
      .x(function(d,i) { return xscale(i) })
      .y(function(d,i) { return yscale(d) }),
```

* You pass a function into `.x()` and `.y()`. These take the data (the object in the array) and its index, and return an x or y location

* `line()` will string this together into the attribute value

---

## Scale

* d3 also provides some scaling helper functions -- that can take a "domain" and a "range" and scale a value from the domain into its position in the range

* For example, if you have values from 0 to 1,000,000 but want to show them on a graphic from locations 0 to 100.

```js
xscale = d3.scaleLinear()
  .domain([0, historyLength])
  .range([0, 600])
```

---

## Scale

* To use the scale, just call it in your x or y functions

```js
  line = d3.line()
      .x(function(d,i) { return xscale(i) })
      .y(function(d,i) { return yscale(d) }),
```

* So here, the x position depends on the *position* in the array (scaled so that 0 to max fits on the chart)

* And the y position depends on the *value* in the array (scaled so that 0 to max fits on the cart)

---

## Updating lines

* If our scale isn't going to change, we can put our line function into a variable at set-up time

```js
  let line = d3.line()
      .x(function(d,i) { return xscale(i) })
      .y(function(d,i) { return yscale(d) }),
```



* We call it using `datum` instead of `data` to update the line attribute whenever we're updating the chart

```js
    xPath.datum(xSpeedHistory).attr('d', line);
```
