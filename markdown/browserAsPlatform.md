Modern web applications involve large amounts of code running on the client-side (in the browser) and on the server-side (responding to requests). So when we design modern web applications, we are designing a system of two programs, talking to each other over a communication protocol.

We're going to start our journey at the client side -- with the browser. We'll begin with a recap getting familiar with the fundamental languages on the client-side: JavaScript and HTML. 

We're also going to need to deal with a bit of legacy. The web has been around for a very long time now. 
ECMAScript (or JavaScript) has recently gone through a lot of updates, but browsers still also try to support all the *old*
pages and websites out there that were written for previous versions.
So, even though we'd like to use the new features of modern versions of JavaScript, we still need to know a bit about the
old versions because they are also (in a sense) current.
